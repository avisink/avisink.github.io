    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Ayomide, pronounced "Ah-yaw-mee-day." I am a second-year computer science student at

            <img src="images/ht_logo_icon.png" alt="Huston-Tillotson Logo" class="inline-logo"> Huston-Tillotson University
        </a>, and my major interests lie in software engineering, specifically machine learning, data science, artificial intelligenceâ€”you know the drill! While working towards being skilled enough to pursue my interests successfully, Iâ€™ve learned to use cool technologies like Python, C++, Swift, Java, OpenCV, Linux Systems, GitHub, GStreamer, and GPUs like the Jetson Nano. I have also worked on projects that have helped me build data visualization skills, data analysis skills, a lot of data stuffðŸ˜„.
        <br><br>
        I've learnt a lot from extraordinary people around me, leading up to building cool stuff with cool people, which has also helped me develop my leadership, teamwork, communication, and critical thinking skills.
